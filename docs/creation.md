# Create a Show

Call sheets house a lot of information. It's why they are so vital to filmmaking. Below is a list of what Callboard offers. Please use this as a guide to creating a complete experience for your production.

* Create a Show
* Invite yourself as crew
* Invite other filmmakers already on the project
* Add scene information from the script to All Scenes
* Add characters from the script in Roles
* Navigate to the first day of filming and create a Shoot Day
* Set Call Times: General, Crew Exceptions and Cast Roles
* Set Location
* Add scenes to Today's Scenes
* Assign crew member to Set Phone
* Add notes: General notes and parking notes
* Invite the remaining Crew
* Invite the remaining Cast

At this point, once all Cast and Crew has joined the project:

* Cast can be assigned to their characters in Roles
* Crew titles can be added in their profiles

Now the project has all the information a call sheet should have. In the process it has also:
- Created a cast list
- Created a crew list
- Verified all phone numbers
- Verified all email addresses
- Received dietary information for meals
- Centralized information

At this point, there are a few options we recommend to insure a successful project.

* Double check the Shoot Day information
* Create a PDF call sheet, for records or anyone without the app
* Upgrade other collaborators to Admins - Careful, they will have the same Admin tools as you, including creating/deleting Shoot Days and removing People from the Show
* Create the rest of the Shoot Days for your show
* Add as much information as you have into future Shoot Days
