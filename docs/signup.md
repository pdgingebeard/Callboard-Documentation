Production has some basic items of information it needs to get everyone to set, check in if someone doesn't arrive on time, make sure everyone has enough food options, and make sure if an emergency arrises that allergies or prexisting conditions will not be overlooked.

Therefore, Callboard will ask for:
* Email address
* Phone number
* Profile picture
* Medical information
* Dietary information
* [Permission](permissions.md) to send notifications

## Email Address

To make sure the [People](people.md) section of the project is flawless, we require verification of your email. There are four steps:
* Enter your email address 
* Create a password
* Find the Callboard email verification
* Verify the information

First, enter the email you wish to use for this app. This email will be visible to admins and might be visable to other users. [See permissions](permissions.md). 

Second, create a password. Make this a strong password. A strong password consists of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols.

Third, check the unread mail of the email you used to sign up. The mail might have gone to the spam folder. Please mark it as not spam, and use the link provided to verify your email.

Lastly, if the link brought you to a 'Thank you, you have been verified,' return to Callboard. There you may either click the button, 'I've been verified', or Callboard has directed you to Phone Number Verification. If you used the wrong email address or accidentally deleted the verification email, you will see buttons for both of those outcomes. 

## Phone Number

To make sure the [People](people.md) section of the project is flawless, we require verification of your phone number via SMS. There are two pages:
* Entering your phone number
* Entering the SMS verification code

First, select your country's flag which provides us with the international phone code. Then enter your mobile number, no dashes or parenthesis needed. When your number is entered hit sumbit, at this point the app will send your phone an SMS message and will move you to the next page.

Second, enter the code you got from your SMS message. Hit submit and you will be verified.

## Profile Picture

To make sure the [People](people.md) section looks professional, we recommend choosing a headshot from your gallery. If you are in a well-lit area, you may also take a picture of yourself using your camera. Each of these options will complete the requirements of a Profile Picture. If you want to change your picture later, you can do so using your camera or from your gallery in your [Profile](profile.md).

* Picture from Gallery: This will prompt a [permissions](permissions.md) requestion. Once you allow, you should be 

## Medical Information

Please do not share information that you do not feel comfortable making known to production. Certain information could include, but is not limited to:
* Allergies
* Recent injuries
* Pre-exisiting Conditions

In order for production to provide everyone with meal and snack options, they generally ask for any dietary restrictions. This could include, but is not limited to:
* Allergies
