This is documentation for Callboard (MORE than a call sheet). A cross platform app for filmmakers. [Check it out](https://callboard.app "Callboard Website")

## Login

If you are a first time user, use the left button Switch to Sign Up.

If you have already created a profile, use the same email as before, enter your password and you will be logged in.

If you have forgotten your password, use the right button Forgot Password? And an email will be sent to you with a link to reset your password.

## Sign Up

Production has some basic items of information it needs to get everyone to set, check in if someone doesn't arrive on time, make sure everyone has enough food options, and make sure if an emergency arrises that allergies or prexisting conditions will not be overlooked.

Therefore, Callboard will ask for:
* Phone number
* Email address
* Profile picture
* Medical information
* Dietary information
* Permission to send notifications

# Permissions

In order to make a more versitile app, we ask permission for our app to do different things. Here is the list of Permissions we may ask for and why we ask for them.

## Notifications

Production uses email to mass communicate with cast and crew. Since the app contains all cast and crew, communication is simplist using the app. Reasons we would send a notification:
* Someone invites you to a show.
* In a show, for a shoot day, your calltime is 12 hrs from now.

## Camera

While creating your profile, we require a picture. If you decide to take a photo in that moment, our app needs your permission to use the camera. This is the only time we access your camera, other than if you decide later to capture a different photo of yourself to replace your current profile picture.

## Gallery

While creating your profile, we require a picture. If you decide to pull a photo of yourself from your phone, our app needs your permission to use access your gallery files. This is the only time we access your gallery, other than if you decide later to select a different photo of yourself to replace your current profile picture.
