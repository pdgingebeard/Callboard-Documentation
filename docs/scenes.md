# Scenes

Scripted media is first determined by, well, the script! In order for the Assistant Director to schedule the film, they must use the slug lines to pull vital information, such as INT/EXT, SETTING, and TIME OF DAY. 

As of version 1.2 of Callboard, we do not support script upload and parsing. If these is a feature you'd like to say in the future, please contact us.

## All Scenes

All Scenes is where we house, in script order, the scene breakdown. Each Scene has fields for:
* Scene Number
* Page Length
* Location INT/EXT
* Location SETTING
* Script Day
* Characters
* Synposis
As of version 1.2 of Callboard, we do not support script revisions (A13), breaking scenes into parts (pt1,pt2), or TV/Series (1.1,2.4). If these is a feature you'd like to say in the future, please contact us.

### Scene Number
Starting at 1, Callboard has logic so you will never have multiple scenes labeled the same number. 
### Page Length

### Location INT/EXT
### Location SETTING
### Script Day
### Characters
### Synposis
