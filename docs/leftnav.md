# Left Navigation

Due to the complexity of a call sheet, we chose to use a Left Navigation Bar to organize information that mostly Admins would use. Below you will find a summary of each section as a User interfaces with it. For a deeper understanding, please find further explanation in Admin Tools or a deeper.
## Profile

Profile is one of Callboard's largest natural advantage to a .pdf call sheet. After signing up, your profile (as of version 1.2) houses:
* Profile picture
* First and last name
* Role
* Email address
* Phone number
* Dietary information
* Medical information
We included all of this information to create People. The People section is the most comprehensive automated Cast List/Crew List availble. See Below for more information.

If you need to edit your profile at all, please see [Edit Profile](profile.md).

## People

People is where the app houses the Crew and Cast Lists. It displays all the people in the show, their profile picture, their name, and their role in the film. If a User has permission, they will be able to use the call or email icons to open that persons phone number or email.

### Cast List

Cast is able to view people's profile but do not have access to anyones phone number or email.

The only people have acess cast phone numbers or emails are the administrators.

### Crew List

Crew is able to view people's profile but only have access to other crew's phone numbers and emails.

They do not have access to cast phone numbers or emails, nor does cast have access to their information.
