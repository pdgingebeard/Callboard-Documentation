# Left Navigation

Due to the complexity of a call sheet, we chose to use a Left Navigation Bar to organize information that mostly Admins would use. Below you will find a summary of each section as a User interfaces with it. For a deeper understanding, please find further explanation in Admin Tools or a deeper.
## Profile

Profile is one of Callboard's largest natural advantage to a .pdf call sheet. After signing up, your profile (as of version 1.2) houses:
* Profile picture
* First and last name
* Role
* Email address
* Phone number
* Dietary information
* Medical information
We included all of this information to create People. The People section is the most comprehensive automated Cast List/Crew List availble. See Below for more information.

If you need to edit your profile at all, please see [Edit Profile](profile.md).
## Current Show

Current show displays the project name that Callboard is pulling information from. Once clicked, Callboard displays the list of shows you're involved in, allowing you to choose between shows. At the bottom of your shows you will see 'Create Show'. [Create Show](creation.md) is the first step into starting a project and becoming an admin.

If 'Create Show' is the only option, check [Invites](#Invites) to see if you have an invite or contact production with the email you signed up with to receive an invite. 
## All Scenes

All Scenes is where we house, in script order, the scene breakdown. Each Scene has fields for:
* Scene Number
* Page Length
* Location INT/EXT
* Location SETTING
* Script Day
* Characters
* Synposis
This is display only for Users. Please contact your Admin if there is an error in their breakdown or if you need to become an Admin on the project.
## People

People is where the app houses the Crew and Cast Lists. It displays all the people in the show, their profile picture, their name, and their role in the film. If a User has permission, they will be able to use the call or email icons to open that persons phone number or email.
### Cast List

Cast is able to view people's profile but do not have access to anyones phone number or email.

The only people have acess cast phone numbers or emails are the administrators.
### Crew List

Crew is able to view people's profile but only have access to other crew's phone numbers and emails.

They do not have access to cast phone numbers or emails, nor does cast have access to their information.
## Invites

Invites houses all invitations for a user to join a show. It will display the name of the show and whether you are cast or crew.

If a User doesn't have any invitations, Callboard displays an envelope icon and the message "No invites were found."

If a User has invitations, Callboard displays a red circle on the Left Navigation Bar. Once the Left Navigation Bar is opened, Callboard displays red circle with the number of outstanding invites 
## Dark Mode

Pretty simple but great. Dark Mode is a toggle switch that turns our original light backgrounds with dark text to dark backgrounds with light text. This will help see information in the dark.
