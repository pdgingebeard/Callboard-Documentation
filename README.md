# hello-world
The education of development begins

Hello world, my name is Preston and I have very little experience.
I am the product owner of a small startup in development of a film app.
I am looking to learn more and help with research and smaller tasks for each sprint.
Looking to revolutionize the film industry with our app.
We will need help accomplishing a feat that no one has been able to master.
I look forward to learning and collaborating with the world.

Cheers!
